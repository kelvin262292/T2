# TechStack

**Recommended Technology Stack**:

- **Application Type**: Web
- **Core Development/Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router) - Chosen due to the pre-existing codebase using it, leveraging familiarity, and its server-side rendering capabilities for SEO and performance. The App Router provides modern routing and data fetching features.
- **Frontend/UI**:
    -   Tailwind CSS - Already in use, providing utility-first CSS for rapid UI development and consistent styling.
    -   TypeScript - Used to enhance code maintainability and readability within the Next.js environment, also leveraging its integration capabilities with tRPC.
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes & tRPC - Utilizing Next.js's built-in API routes for backend logic. Used tRPC to create typesafe API between the client side Next.js app and server side API routes. This approach simplifies backend development and deployment, and ensures type safety throughout the application.
- **Database/Storage**: N/A (Not Specified) - The current cart implementation uses `CartContext`, suggesting a client-side storage approach (like local storage or cookies) may be in use. It is not specified whether to use Database system or not.
- **Hosting/Deployment**: Vercel - Seamlessly integrates with Next.js for easy deployment and hosting, with automatic performance optimizations.
- **Build Tools**: Next.js CLI - Built-in tooling simplifies common development tasks like building, running, and deploying the application.
- **Additional Tools**:
    -   Authentication: NextAuth.js (Recommended Choice) - A complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It supports multiple authentication strategies and user management workflows. Compatible with many providers and databases.
    -   Analytics: Google Analytics - Industry standard for website traffic analysis. Easy to integrate into Next.js applications.

**Justification and Explanation**:

This stack builds upon the existing Next.js application, leveraging the developer's familiarity with Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, tRPC, and Tailwind CSS.

*   **Product Detail Pages, Cart Page, Checkout Flow, Authentication Pages, User Account Pages, Search Results, Error Pages:** These pages can be efficiently built using Next.js components and the existing Tailwind CSS setup for styling. Typesafe API are implemented with tRPC.
*   **Next.js API routes:** Handle backend logic associated with checkout, user authentication, and account management.
*   **Authentication:** NextAuth.js provides flexible framework for managing authentication flows and integrating with existing database or auth provider, such as Supabase, while being open-source and customizable solution.
*   **CartContext:** Is already in place. If client-side storage proves insufficient for the cart functionality, consider integrating a database (like Supabase or Planetscale) for more robust cart persistence and features (e.g., saving carts for logged-in users).

**Trade-offs:**

*   **Client-side cart storage:** Simple to implement initially but might be less reliable than a database-backed cart and limits cart persistence across devices for unauthenticated users.
*   **Next.js API routes-based backend:** Simple for many scenarios but may require a more dedicated backend (Node.js/Express) as complexity grows or significant server functions or performance needs arise.
